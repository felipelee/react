/**
 * Motion intent: trigger a circular reveal from the user's touch point that switches app theme.
 * Why: originating the mask at the press center creates a direct causeâ†’effect link and feels tactile.
 * Timing: 500ms balances snappiness with perceptibility of the radial expansion.
 * Platform: uses native haptics for lightweight confirmation; the animation is handled by the library on the UI thread.
