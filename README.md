## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

```
make-it-animated/
â”œâ”€â”€ app/                  # Expo Router navigation structure
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ (apps)/           # Group containing individual animation routes
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ (a-c)/        # Alphabetically grouped app routes
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ (d-f)/        # Alphabetically grouped app routes
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...           # More route groups
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ _layout.tsx       # Main layout for the app
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.tsx         # Entry point/home screen
â”œâ”€â”€ assets/               # Images, fonts, and other static resources
â”œâ”€â”€ src/                  # Source code for animations
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ apps/             # Individual animation implementations
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ (a-c)/        # Alphabetically grouped apps
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ (d-f)/        # Alphabetically grouped apps
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...           # More apps groups
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ shared/           # Shared components and utilities
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ components/   # Reusable UI components
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ lib/          # Utility functions and hooks
```

### Key Directories Explained

- **app/**: Contains all the Expo Router navigation setup. Each folder corresponds to a route group.
- **src/apps/**: Contains the actual implementation code for each app animation, grouped alphabetically.
- **src/shared/**: Contains reusable components, hooks, and utilities used across the app.

### App Animation Structure

Each app (e.g src/apps/(g-i)/gmail) typically follows this structure:

```
app-name/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/           # Components specific to this app (optional)
â”œâ”€â”€ lib/                  # Hooks, utils, providers, constants for this app (optional)
â””â”€â”€ routes/               # Route files for the app which will be used by Expo Router
```
